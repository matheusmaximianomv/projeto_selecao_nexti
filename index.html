He needed something relatively fast that could deal with a series, almost constant, of activities involved in something like Linux, having the same to be free. Finding nothing, he decided to create Git. As in the case of Linux, Torvalds baptized him in reference to himself; in British English, Git is a slang for "hardheaded, who thinks he's always right, quarrelsome."</p></div>

Suppose your project is an HTML site, and you want to create a new section in your HTML code, but at that point you do not want these changes to be available to anyone else, just for you. That is, you want to change the project (including multiple files in it), but you still do not want this to be treated as "official" to other people, so you create a branch (like a mirror copy) , until you hit all the details of it. After that, you can merge back from your branch to the original project.</p></div>
